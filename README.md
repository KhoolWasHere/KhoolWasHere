I am a 14-year-old full-stack web and game developer with a deep technical toolkit, including C, C#, Javascript (including many major frameworks), as well as moden web design with CSS, Tailwind, and Bootstrap. I enjoy building games with Unity and as well as dabbling in Unreal Engine and .NET solutions.
